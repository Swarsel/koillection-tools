Mr. DOB was inspired by two comedic phrases, ""Dobojite"" from the gag comic Inakappe Taishō by Noboru Kawasaki and “Oshamanbe” used by comedian Toru Yuri. In these silly pun-based gags, the groove seemed important, which led Murakami to question the meaning of emphatic letters like ""A,"" ""Z,"" and ""X"" affixed to titles and product names. To explore, he took ""DOB"" from “DOBOZITE” and adopted it as an artwork for his exhibition. The design of the character was completed with the help of students and professional designers, with a concept sketch brushed up on a Mac computer. In its formation process, the character went through some iterations, such as having three ears at one point, but at the suggestion of a professional, it settled into the form you see today.
In ""And Then"", Mr. DOB stares at the viewer with a grin on his face, rendered through the artist's characteristic nihilism and cynicism.

First, each work starts with a small rough sketch by Murakami, the details of which are worked out in digital data to render them in a card-game-style illustration. The data is then submitted for printing and become a card. This is the end of the process for a normal card production, but the challenge of this project is that each illustration is then turned into a painting. The numerous colors are separated in the data, and the rough colors are applied to the canvas with silkscreens. The details are then finished off with airbrush, one by one, to a level of perfection that is worthy of a painting.

Whether it pertains to beauty, greed, or money, the relationship between human nature and art has changed over time.
The desire to own a work of art is proportional to its rarity. Popular works of art are auctioned off and their prices soar because of their popularity, and people get galvanized and go into a frenzy. Once that madness subsides, the true value of the work comes into sharp relief. If the piece is authentic, its popularity will continue to gradually increase and its value will rise. Conversely, a sham will disappear from the market. Please carefully observe the values that survives the test of time.
