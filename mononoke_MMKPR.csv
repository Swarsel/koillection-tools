MMKPR-010,DOB君 パールゴールドホワイト,https://mmktc.kaikaikiki.comassets/images/card/EN_MMKPR-010.jpg,"Mr. DOB was born in 1993. It took about five days of Murakami staying at the house of Manabu Koga, a 19-year-old aspiring designer (now artist) who had just purchased an Apple II at the time, and working with him to create the character. The name ""DOB"" is a nonsensical word that is a combination of “dobojite,” a Japanese slang at the time for ""why?” and comedian Toru Yuri's gag phrase, ""Oshamanbe.""
Murakami took the first three letters of ""DOBOZITE"" as the name of the character. Some thought it was an imitation of a certain mouse character, but it is not. This body color is Pearl Gold White.",R
MMKPR-011,カイカイ ブラック&ホワイト,https://mmktc.kaikaikiki.comassets/images/card/EN_MMKPR-011.jpg,"In the renowned book by the Japanese art historian Nobuo Tsuji, Lineage of Eccentrics, he mentions a word in the eulogy of Kanō Eitoku, the fourth-generation master of the Kano school, by his disciple: kaikaikiki. It means ""entirely out of ordinary, very mysterious and bizarre,"" and Murakami, who resonated with it, borrowed this word as the name of his painting studio. Later, he separated Kaikai and Kiki and made them into characters. One of them is Kaikai. This is the black-and-white version.",SR

The letter “P” of PANDA is on each of his ears.

For no particular reason… mumble mumble…”

MMKPR-015,小パンダ「方法序説」,https://mmktc.kaikaikiki.comassets/images/card/JP_MMKPR-015.jpg,"“I think, therefore I am” is a famous philosophical principle from Descartes's treatise, Discourse on the Method. Because we are alive, we eat. And things that need to come out would come out. Little Panda is thinking about the meaning of life while farting atop the flower ball... or not... lol....
“I think, therefore I am… Oops, I farted!”
Little Panda’s philosophy has achieved a true state of nothingness.
