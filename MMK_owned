MMK-053,お猿さん,https://mmktc.kaikaikiki.comassets/images/card/JP_MMK-053_UR.jpg,"A lone monkey sits on a kashiwa oak branch and stretches its fingertips toward the water surface. Although the creature is said to be a round-faced Chinese monkey, its cute eyes and nose that are rendered like symbols, as well as its mischievous smiling mouth, seem to anticipate character culture of our times. The gesture of the monkey reaching out with its hand while keeping balance is depicted simply yet realistically. “Monkey”, the basis of this image, is a painting by Kanō Sansetsu, the second-generation master of the Kyō Kanō school, a branch of Kanō school that remained in Kyoto after the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate.
