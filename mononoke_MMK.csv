MMK-052,土田麦僊インスパイア舞妓さん,https://mmktc.kaikaikiki.comassets/images/card/JP_MMK-052_UR.jpg,"Maiko is one of the quintessential characters that symbolize Kyoto. They are also popular as a subject of art and many paintings with Maiko motif exist, but this image is based on one of the most famous maiko paintings, “Maiko in a Garden” by Tsuchida Bakusen. The painting depicts a maiko with the garden of Tenju-an in Nanzenji Temple, Kyoto, in the background. The strict compositional order, which the artist mastered during a study tour of Europe, as well as the meticulous depiction of the maiko, in the manner typical of Taisho era, are impressive. The painting has been revived here as a modern anime-style character.
