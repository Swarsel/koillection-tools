CMAPR-005,Let's Go See the Nuclear Reactor,https://mfctc.kaikaikiki.comassets/images/card/CMAPR-005.jpg,"This work is part of the ""Excuse Painting"" series, in which explanatory text about the painting’s content is embedded within the artwork itself.
The lyrics depicted in this work are from a music video themed around the world after the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, when the Fukushima nuclear power plant exploded.
“Let’s Go See the Nuclear Reactor!”
Next Sunday, my girlfriend and I, we’re gonna go see the nuclear reactor. We’ll take the Yamanote Line and then the bullet train, and then rent a car, drive on out to No. 2.
Last month at the protest march, we were the only ones who didn’t know much about the nuclear reactors.
Everyone else seemed to know so much, not just about the reactors, but about food contamination, companies trading seeds, problems with imports. But we didn’t know anything.
Even if we tried to read up, we probably wouldn’t understand anyways, so we decided to go have a look for ourselves
instead.
And so we arrived.
We made it into the “Restricted Area” no problem.
It was so easy to get through. Our spirits were high.
And then we saw it.
Reactor No. 2. It felt so sublime…
Oh the wind coming off of the sea, it was so chilling. But the birds were singing
and the flowers were grinning, such a beautiful place. Like a science fiction movie, we felt like we were walking in a post-apocalyptic world.
Oh what a thrill.
My nose was running ’cause I have hay fever and I couldn’t stop sneezing.
Our next destination…
That famous ghost town shopping street. We were looking forward to seeing wild boars like we saw on Television but we didn’t see any, and nothing much happened.
On our way back, the shops were open for business as usual and we had some spectacular seafood.
“Aren’t you glad we came?” We felt warm and satisfied.
“Do you think humans will always look the
same?”
“Nah, we’ll genetically modify ourselves so we can withstand radiation and mutate.”
“No, no, no, I think we’ll all die out,”
we said as we smoked in the parking lot outside the convenience store.
Oh the wind coming off of the sea, it was so chilling. But the birds were singing and the flowers were grinning, such a beautiful place. Like a science fiction movie, we felt like we were walking in a post-apocalyptic world.
Oh what a thrill.
And then we thought about our future happiness.
What is true happiness?
When I got home, I borrowed my friend’s Geiger counter and took a reading from the bottom of my shoes. It made a horrible sound and so I tossed those shoes away.
Oh the wind coming off of the sea, it was so chilling. But the birds were singing and the flowers were grinning, such a beautiful place. Like a science fiction movie, we felt like we were walking in a post-apocalyptic world. Oh what a
thrill.
We never did join another march.
“Next time, let’s go see some giant crater in Russia or Battleship Island,” we said. That’s our plan anyway…

CMAPR-006,What Did the LV Project Mean to Me?,https://mfctc.kaikaikiki.comassets/images/card/CMAPR-006.jpg,"The Multicolor Monogram pattern was born out of my collaboration with Louis Vuitton.
In 2002, I simultaneously held two exhibitions at the Fondation Cartier pour l’art contemporain in Paris: my solo show, Kawaii! Vacances d’été! on the first floor, and a group exhibition I curated in order to explore the state of post-war Japanese art, titled Coloriage, on the ground floor. My 40-persons team, Kaikai Kiki, a completely disorganized organization in name only at the time, flew in from Japan, and with the help of Galerie Perrotin’s Emmanuel Perrotin and just a handful of assistants he had then, managed to pack everything I wanted to do in these shows. On the opening day, I have somehow managed to displease the Foundation’s director Hervé Chandès and half of my staff quit. I returned home to Japan dejected, wondering whether this was really what I had hoped for. As I was busy trying to recruit replacement staff, Marc Jacobs reached out to me, inviting me to
collaborate with him for Louis Vuitton. Not only that, he asked me to come to Paris right away, though I had literally just returned from Paris. Really? So I asked my staff what they thought, and the young women among them immediately insisted, “You must do it!” with sparkles in their eyes. That’s how I ended up going to meet Marc in Paris four days after I received his email.
Since Marc asked me to come all the way and it made my female staff’s eyes shine, I understood this to be something significant. When I met Marc in his office at the Louis Vuitton headquarters, he told me that he wanted to renew the brand’s monogram and wanted me to come up with ideas with him; he said he wasn’t asking me to design characters or anything like that. The meeting, however, lasted all of 15 minutes. What? I was then taken on a tour of what turned out to be their factory/museum, where I learned about the history of Louis Vuitton. What what?
So I went right back to
Japan, thought of various plans, and started to email ideas to Marc—at which point I learned that he and the entire Louis Vuitton were away for summer vacation. Back then, I had no familiarity with such Western norms and cultures, so once again, I was taken back. I decided to spend the rest of the summer preparing for the project, to be ready when they returned. As I had been told at the museum that the history of their monogram had originated in Japanese family crests, I thought of merging old Asian patterns predating such culture of family crests in Japan. I bought a lot of books (I recall that the online search functions back then weren’t powerful enough for me to sufficiently look these things up on the internet) and prepared some proposals, combining some historical patterns from Southeast Asia and China with the Louis Vuitton monogram. Meanwhile, Marc emailed me out of the blue during his vacation to say, mysteriously, “This is cute!” with his sketch of a
panda-like character from Tan Tan Bo Puking, a painting that was on view at the Cartier Foundation featuring my main character, Mr. DOB, and its many variations. What? I thought he wasn’t interested in characters, so why panda? Wondering if he liked the colors in the painting as well, I started incorporating the colors from the panda character in the monogram and sent it to Marc. “Beautiful,” was his immediate response. Wow! Seeing that Marc liked the direction I was going, I designed various characters and sent him variations on the colorful monogram, and Marc started to give me specific feedbacks and instructions. All the while, I continued to work on merging the Asian patterns with the monogram.
Finally, the vacation season was over and our communication intensified. With the September fashion week looming, things quickly started to fall into places and I responded to various requests. Several versions of Multicolor Monogram were quickly finalized, with
and without my signature eyeballs and on white and black backgrounds, and another with cherry blossoms characters. We still had a little bit of time until the show, so I casually proposed an idea of floating some balloons shaped like the newly created characters in the event space, and it was realized. The show was held successfully, and to my relief, it was generally well received.
But I questioned myself what the point of this project would be, to me as an artist, if this was all there was to it. And so I decided that I had to make the newly colorful monograms into art, in the form of paintings. The items introduced at the runway show would be turned into products in the next six months, so I knew I had to do an exhibition of my Multicolor Monogram paintings to coincide with the product release. I also told myself that I had to produce paintings and sculptures featuring the panda and other characters from the collaboration. So one day, half a year after
the Paris runway show, I held just such a solo show at a commercial gallery in NY. The works were received and sold well, and Louis Vuitton was kind enough to promote the show. They also supported a major group exhibition curated by Francesco Bonami later that year at the Venice Biennale, titled Pittura/Painting: From Rauschenberg to Murakami, 1964-2003.
Now the stage would move to the Venice Biennale, which would eventually lead to this Artforum cover. While artists from around the world were working on presenting elaborate exhibitions for this festival of art, on the streets of Venice, fake versions of the Multicolor Monogram bags were being sold. The then-editorial staff of Artforum, young Scott Rothkopf, now the Senior Deputy Director and Senior Curator of the Whitney Museum of American Art, apparently saw a photo of these fake bags among the many images sent to him and had a proper photographer go and reshoot it (at least I seem to remember hearing
such an anecdote). And that was how this photograph came to adorn the cover of Artforum, the foremost art review magazine. Perhaps Scott Rothkopf understood that the fake bags sold on the streets of Venice comprehensively encompassed the twisted relationship between authenticity, fake, art, commerce, and more. I was filled with gratitude! I truly thanked heavens for my incredible good luck. I felt that alas, finally, a Japanese artist has managed to join hands with the Western art world and, if through a twisted contexture, secured a standing in the art historical context.
Soon after, however, this achievement was unexpectedly swept away from art history into oblivion and the Multicolor Louis Vuitton paintings are no longer popular in the art market. But with the generational turnover, Virgil Abloh, the current Men’s creative director for Louis Vuitton, remembered this collaboration; he has told me that one of the very first art experiences for him and his
friends, who had little chance to come in contact with art growing up in Chicago, was the Multicolor Monogram collaboration between Marc Jacobs and Murakami. I was truly happy to hear this, and I believe that after my death, a day will come when the Louis Vuitton Multicolor Monogram paintings will earn the highest recognition. What I meant to say here is that this Artforum cover may be one of the indicators pointing to such a possibility.

CMAPR-007,Birth and Evolution of Mr. DOB,https://mfctc.kaikaikiki.comassets/images/card/CMAPR-007.jpg,"Is it possible to create an icon that holds as art? This theme was the reason why I started making Mr. DOB. I wanted to verify the “survival secret,” or universality, of cute characters such as Mickey Mouse, Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog, Doraemon, Miffy, Hello Kitty, etc. while crossbreeding it with the universality of artists that have managed to survive in art history, such as Cézanne, Duchamp, Warhol, Picasso, etc. Executing and analyzing this idea was my initial purpose for the DOB Project.
It began while I was in the midst of preparing my solo exhibition, A Romantic Evening (1993), at a gallery in Nagoya. I dubbed my plan for the show “Z Project,” wherein I set out to examine the custom of affixing a “Z” or an “X” to anything from a beer product name to manga titles to connote a sense of emphasis. Why do people react positively to these alphabetic emphases, as in Jackie Chan’s movie Project A and Akira Toriyama’s Dragon Ball Z? Why are they needed? In
order to experiment and verify this idea, I was trying to make a piece that rendered a large letter “Z"" as an illuminated signboard. When I got a quote, however, it was way too expensive for my price point at the time that I had to let the idea go. I was now pressed to come up with an alternative project involving a work that could be produced inexpensively and still let me contemplate the alphabetic emphasis.
I had a midnight phone conference with the art university students who were assisting me with the project, but as I was so young myself, we couldn’t help laughing at every little thing mentioned and struggled to have any constructive discussion. Amidst this exchange, someone brought up the famous 1970s humor manga Inakappe Taishō by Noboru Kawasaki, and recalling its silly word-play gags such as “kyatto kūchū sankaiten (a cat doing a triple spin in the air),” “dobozite dobozite… (why, why…),” and “...dazona, moshikashite (it may be so, perhaps),” we
exploded with more laughter. We were talking non-stop till morning and it dawned on me that this kind of groove was actually really important in life. I had been wondering why such alphabetic emphases as “A,” “Z,” or “X” were necessary, but I started to think that the joy of meaningless pronunciation might be the essence of what elevated our mood. So I decided to make a work about the fact that we can get excited without any meaning by using “DOBOZITE” like the alphabetic emphasis. And since “DOBOZITE” would be too long, why don’t we just use “DOB”? That was how I ended up with “DOB” instead of “Z” as a piece for my exhibition.
At the time, there was a huge boom in Japan of language (text) art by Barbara Kruger and others, with Jenny Holzer having an exhibition. There were copycat works by Japanese artists emerging, often with spelling mistakes as they used English words. I was furious about the Japanese contemporary art scene that readily sucked up to the
trends in NY. To make the matter worse, there were Japanese art critics who took pains to admire such mock art. You fools! I will destroy such an art scene in Japan! I got all fired up, determined to strike out with the silly phrase “DOB” taken from a manga gag.
For the design of the work, the art university students who were helping me brought in various magazines and CDs and we discussed about the potential character. We arrived at a simplistic yet essential answer that a character’s development had to do with a history of crossbreeding. This finally gave us the clear idea for starting the design. I had the general framework within a couple of days and started to convert it into the actual design. I first sketched out my image for the character, and Manabu Koga, a student at a vocational school at the time, was kind enough to brush it up for me. We decided to have it further refined by Gento Matsumoto, a professional graphic designer, and, after repeated
back and forth, we arrived at the DOB character in the present form. At some point in the process DOB had three ears, with “D,” “O,” and “B” on each ear, but the professional advised that we should have the face read as an “O,” so that’s how we ended up with the character we have now. And so I made the character, silkscreened it onto a painting, printed it on a T-shirt for good measure, and ta-da! I presented it at the exhibition. However! It was extremely poorly received by the Japanese art people. I had been highly unpopular right from the time of my debut in Japan. So my icon-creation project “DOB” had a terrible start. But I stuck to my initial conviction and faithfully continued on without altering my thinking, and it started to take shape.
In the end, DOB is a character and artwork that was meant to be born.
I have had a long relationship with it, and it keeps changing every day.
Once a character is born, it starts to indicate what it wants to
be, as though asserting its own will. Like a child, a character grows up on its own. And now, it has even become a soft vinyl toy.

CMAPR-008,Excuse Painting: On the Relationship Between Art and Money,https://mfctc.kaikaikiki.comassets/images/card/CMAPR-008.jpg,"The relationship between art and money is something I am often asked about in interviews. What the interviewers tend to want is to speak for the public in their indignation that the price of art is too high and so they try out all sorts of tactics to find fault with me. As I’m not very tactful, I tend to fall for such tricks and say needless things, and from time to time my tactless comments would adorn the headline of some article or another, making me cringe. So these days I don’t readily agree to interviews. I collect artworks that are not too expensive, but my addiction only grows deeper with time, and for many years, I have been exploring the reason for my growing addiction through experience. Why do people become so obsessed with art and end up paying incredible amount of money for it? I have been searching for the answer to this question in my own way. By repeating the experience of purchasing art within my means, I have eventually arrived at this answer:
The act of obtaining an artwork lets one get drunk on the extremely realistic illusion that one can freely journey across time and space, which in turn lets one completely forget about death. And since I’m a painter, I am able to further delve into a more specialized realm with this experience. The moment I obtain an artwork, I reflect on the brush and pencil marks left on the work in my mind, which enables me to synchronize with the filament of blinking ideas in the artist’s brain. The artist enters me through their work and I start to become something other than myself. As I’m not a musician I’m not sure if this is an apt analogy, but when a musician plays a piece of music looking at a score, I imagine that they come into contact with the composer’s soul. What if they saw a hand-written score by the composer? I'm almost certain that the moment in which the composer, be it Mozart, Chopin, or John Lennon, created the music would vividly flood the musician’s mind
and allow them to travel back to that time. Ah, perhaps my analogy isn’t quite working, but in any case it’s a truly wonderful experience to acquire a work of art. And I can imagine how one wouldn’t regret destroying one's wealth and reputation if one could experience obtaining a work one sincerely loves and deeply cares for… Though it’s only an imagination since I haven’t ever managed to cast a fortune in such a way myself. I therefore believe that when it comes to buying art, it is meaningless to speak in relative terms and judge a price to be too expensive. We all die eventually. If art is a device that grants us a moment to be fundamentally free from fear of death, then it should be a matter of course that it would cost as much as it would to build a time machine. I don’t know whether I myself will manage to create a work that could serve as such a device, but I am working hard on it day in and day out.

CMAPR-011,Yumedono Inspired by the Shōgun Team 2025,https://mfctc.kaikaikiki.comassets/images/card/CMAPR-011.jpg,"Murakami says that the American period drama series, Shōgun, which has been airing and distributing since 2024, has knocked him right out of his brain. What an amazing reinterpretation of Japanese cultural barriers! The idea that samurai of the Sengoku (warring states) period may have approached life with a creative spirit—crafting their own narratives of existence through acts of seppuku and writing death poems—seemed to offer one possible answer to the modern question of what it means to live. At the same time, Murakami was deeply moved by the art direction in the series. When he asked Disney Japan if he could meet the production designer, Helen Jarvis, he was told that producer Justin Marks and screenwriter Rachel Kondo happened to be visiting Japan for promotion and research. Murakami met with them, which in turn connected him with Helen, and from there, this project got started.
Yumedono is a real structure located in Nara, themed around the concept of
dreams. A National Treasure, the octagonal hall at Hōryū-ji was built during the Nara period in honor of Prince Shōtoku, and enshrines the Kuse Kannon as its principal deity.
With the idea of exhibiting four large paintings of the Four Symbols (shishin) inside, Murakami’s structure was produced in a very short time under Jarvis's direction by the production company 11th Street Workshop with the coordination of its manager, Korey White.",UR
CMAPR-012,Kaikai & Kiki,https://mfctc.kaikaikiki.comassets/images/card/CMAPR-012.jpg,"The phrase “kaikaikiki,"" which was used to praise the genius of Kanō Eitoku of the Kanō school, is said to mean ""unconventional and transcending even the ultimate beauty."" The Kanō school was a powerful artistic lineage that lasted over 400 years, and its mastery of art was deeply tied to its apprenticeship system. Takashi Murakami named his studio Kaikai Kiki after this expression. Because “kaikai"" and “kiki"" sounded cute, he also turned them into characters—and that’s how these two creatures were born.
